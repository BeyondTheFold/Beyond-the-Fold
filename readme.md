# Beyond the Fold

## Overview

Beyond the Fold is a project to visualize a user's path while browsing
the web. It consists of two components:

- A voluntarily installed web extension to monitor a user's relative position
- A visualizing tool that can be used to import the graph from localstorage

The intialial end product was intended to be a physical manifestation of
the paths through time. 

## Monitor

The monitor tracks:
- Duration of a page visit
- The parent/child relationship between websites
- The uniqueness of a page visit
- Whether the page was reached via. a web search

## Visualizer

The visualization tool was constructed in a way such that visible page visit's 
(indicated by a node) can be filtered out by the duration of that visit.

## To Do
- Define minimum and maximum anglular separation between nodes
  - calculate number of nodes that can fit within this separation
- Find out why first level nodes are connecting
- Clean up and comment code
- Ensure nodes aren't drawn after specified threshold is met
[x] Find out why local storage isn't being updated immediatly
- Gather data
 
## Short Comings
- Duration is still counted when user walks away from computer
