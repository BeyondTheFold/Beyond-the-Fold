# Image Visualization

## Introduction
### Purpose

The standard user interface of most image-centric social media services display 
images and data in a linear fasion. This project seeks to expore alternative 
perspectives of the universe of the internal represenations of one of these
services.

### Definitions

* Graph
* Edge
* Node
* Image
* Latitude
* Longitude
* Datetime
* Meta-data
* Tags

### System Overview

#### Core Technologies

* Processing Programming Language [[link]()]
* Python Programming Language [[link]()]

#### Collection

A python script will make calls to an API requesting posts from
predefined geographical areas. The targeted information from each post will be 
as follows:

* User name
* Following
* Followers
* Image
* Image metadata
	* Latitude
	* Longitude
	* Datetime

This data will then be inserted into a database.

#### User Stories

1. User opens application
2. Digital map is focused on user's position
3. User hovers over node
4. Image expands
5. User clicks on node
6. Corosel UI is presented 
	--- How, in what order? Doesn't this re-linearize the data? ---
